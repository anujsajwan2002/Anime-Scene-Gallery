# ðŸŽ¬ Anime Scene Gallery

An interactive gallery featuring iconic scenes from my favorite anime series, built with React and Framer Motion. Each title reveals three carefully chosen scenes with dynamic animations and mouse-tracked motion effects.

## Technologies

- `React`
- `TypeScript`
- `Framer Motion`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Vite`

##  Features


- Spring physics for natural-feeling animations
- Each title reveals three iconic scenes when hovered
- Scenes respond to mouse movement with parallax effects
- Adapts to different screen sizes with mobile warnings
 
## The Process

I started with a simple idea: create an engaging way to showcase my favorite anime scenes. The process involved:

1. Setting up the base structure with React and Vite
2. Implementing hover interactions and scene reveals
3. Adding Framer Motion for smooth animations
4. Fine-tuning mouse-tracking and parallax effects
5. Optimizing performance and adding mobile responsiveness
